# Rivers_Statistics_21_22

This repo will house tutorials, data challenges, and projects used in the Rivers School's Statistics class during the 2021-2022 school year.

## Tutorials: 
This will be the place for you to start. This folder will house examples from which you can begin to learn how to code. Read carefully as there are questions within each example that will force you to take a close look at the code and develop your understanding of how to adjust the code. 

##Data Challenges:
The goal here is to learn by doing!! You can watch videos and read through example code, but it isn't until you start writing, running, and editing code that you will begin to learn. This section will have you diving into datasets to uncover hidden stories. 

##Projects:
This will house any documents needed for your to get started on a project.

##Practice Area:
Check out this section to see explorations done in class and extra help sessions.
